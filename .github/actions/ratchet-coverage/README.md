# Ratchet coverage

Generate code coverage using `cargo llvm-cov` and fail the workflow if the
coverage percentage falls below a stored baseline.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| baseline-file | File used to persist the baseline coverage percentage between runs | no | `.coverage-baseline` |
| args | Additional arguments passed to `cargo llvm-cov` | no | `''` |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| percent | Coverage percentage reported by `cargo llvm-cov` |

## Example

```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/setup-rust@v1
- uses: ./.github/actions/ratchet-coverage@v1
  with:
    baseline-file: .cache/coverage-baseline
    args: --workspace
```

On Windows runners `bc` is installed via MSYS2, so the float comparison works
the same across platforms.

### How it works

The action restores the previous coverage baseline using
[actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) and installs
`cargo-llvm-cov` if necessary. After running the coverage command, it compares
the new percentage with the stored baseline. Both values are rounded to two
decimals before comparison to avoid failures from floatingâ€‘point noise. The job
fails if coverage drops. On success, the baseline file is updated and saved back
to the cache for future runs.

## Caching

Two caches are used: one for the baseline file and another for cargo
artifacts and the `cargo-llvm-cov` binary. The baseline cache is restored when
the action starts and saved again after updating the file. The cargo cache
uses the operating system and the checksum of `Cargo.lock` to avoid rebuilds.

### Requirements

- The Rust toolchain must already be installed (for example via the
  [setup-rust](../setup-rust) action).
- Windows runners automatically install `bc` using MSYS2.
